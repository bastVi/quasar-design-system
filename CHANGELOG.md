# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Fields**: a Windows 11 (WinUI 3) finish, with a layer fill, an elevation border and a strong bottom stroke.
  On focus the field switches to the input-active fill and shows the accent bar. Fields have no halo by default.
  Quasar `color`, forced colours and reduced motion are respected.
- Field anatomy:
  - A required mark on labels of `required` / `aria-required` controls, or with `.qds-field--required`.
  - `.qds-field__hint` for the QInput `#label` slot.
  - A `.qds-form-field` wrapper for any control: header, label, hint, description, help and error, with
    `--required` and `--horizontal` modifiers.
- Field variants: `.qds-field--ghost` and the `.qds-field--positive` / `--warning` validation tints.
- Form compositions:
  - `.qds-field-group` joins inputs, selects and buttons.
  - `kbd` / `.qds-kbd` keycaps.
  - `.qds-field--stepper` number fields.
  - `.qds-field--dropzone` file tiles.
  - `.qds-pin` code rows.
  - `.qds-option-group--card` option tiles.
- Settings cards: `.qds-settings-group` / `.qds-settings-card` rows with icon, header, description and action,
  plus an expander variant on `QExpansionItem`.
- App compositions:
  - `.qds-menu-row` rich menu items with `__icon`, `__title`, `__caption` and `__description`; multi-line rows
    align to the title line.
  - `.qds-subpage-tabs`: left-aligned 36px underline tabs over a hairline divider, with padded panels below.
  - `.qds-table-segmented`: a 24px `QBtnToggle` inside a 32px dense table row.
  - `.qds-tile-grid` / `.qds-tile` dashboard tiles with `__icon`, `__label`, `__value`, `__meta` and a `__spark`
    sparkline; `--alert` / `--warning` / `--positive` tint the icon, meta and sparkline and add a tone ring that
    stays visible in cards, Ink and forced colours.
  - `.qds-sr-only` visually hidden text.
  - Tokens `--qds-tile-min-width` (9rem) and `--qds-tile-spark-height` (2rem).
- Gallery: a new **Forms** tab covering:
  - anatomy, variants × sizes and states;
  - compositions;
  - Store-style category pills;
  - a Windows 11 Settings-style page.
- Gallery: a new **Apps** tab with consumer-app compositions on the Mica backdrop:
  - a split button with rich menu rows;
  - an expanded and mini NavigationView with nested destinations;
  - a four-tab settings subpage;
  - a dense table with segmented controls and expandable incident rows;
  - Dashboard, List-detail and Dialog flow screens with a responsive tile grid.

### Changed

- **Windows 11 control layer**: new tokens `--qds-control-fill-input-active`,
  `--qds-control-stroke-default|secondary|strong|top|bottom|on-accent-top|on-accent-bottom`, `--qds-card-fill`,
  `--qds-card-stroke` and `--qds-control-halo`. `--qds-control-fill-*` are now translucent layer values instead of
  aliases of `--qds-surface-*`, so surface overrides no longer flow into them; override the control tokens directly.
  Ink, Term, reduced transparency, forced colours and browsers without `backdrop-filter` use opaque layers and
  no halo.
- **Buttons**: neutral filled buttons use the layer fill with an elevation border; accent buttons gain a light top
  and dark bottom edge (not on date picker selections); pressed neutral text is muted.
- **Chips**: layer fill with an elevation border; clickable and selected chips show the halo.
- **Cards**: a flat translucent layer with a hairline `--qds-card-stroke`; `--qds-card-shadow` defaults to `none`.
  Nested cards stay strokeless; maximized dialog cards stay opaque.
- **Lists**: the active item is a subtle pill with an accent indicator bar.
- `.qds-field--required` is visual only; pair it with `required` or `aria-required` for assistive technology.
- **Breaking — variant IDs**: `mobile` is now `one` and `terminal` is now `term` (labels **One** and **Term**).
  The runtime writes `qds-variant-one` / `qds-variant-term` and `data-qds-variant="one|term"`. `mobile` and
  `terminal` are still accepted as legacy aliases (options, `setVariant`, persisted state), but the
  `.qds-variant-mobile` / `.qds-variant-terminal` classes are no longer emitted or styled; update any consumer
  selectors that target them. The `$variants` map in `./tokens/default` is keyed `one` / `term` as well.
- **Fluent geometry (Windows 11)**: `--qds-radius-control` is 4px and `--qds-radius-lg` (cards, dialogs, tables,
  bordered lists) is 8px; list and navigation rows (`--qds-row-radius`) use the 4px control radius at 36px. Ink,
  One and Term keep their own radii. Quasar's compile-time Sass radii (`$generic-border-radius` and friends) come
  from `$radius control` and are global to every variant, so QTable cards, `.rounded-borders` and default-shape
  QSkeletons now read the runtime radius tokens instead.
- **Fluent light surfaces**: a Mica-like base — `--qds-surface-1` `#f3f3f3`, `--qds-surface-2` `#eeeeee`,
  `--qds-surface-3` `#e8e8e8` — so layers separate from the page. Dark surfaces are unchanged.
- **Solid role buttons**: in Fluent, hover and press lighten toward the layer (95% / 90% of the role fill) and the
  pressed label uses the 90% on-fill text, keeping ≥ 4.5:1 at rest and hover and ≥ 3:1 pressed for every role in
  light and dark. New tokens `--qds-color-primary-hover`, `--qds-fill-hover-mix`, `--qds-fill-pressed-mix`,
  `--qds-fill-state-base` and `--qds-text-on-fill-pressed-mix`. Checked checkbox, radio and toggle hovers use
  `--qds-color-primary-hover` too. Ink, One and Term keep their darker states.
- **Breaking — pressed primary**: `--qds-color-primary-pressed` is now derived from the fill-state tokens (a lighter
  Fluent press) instead of the fixed dark `#0c3b5e`, and the `primary-pressed` key is removed from the `$palette` /
  `$dark-palette` maps in `./tokens/default`. Consumers that read either should use `--qds-color-primary-dark` for
  a darker primary.
- **Touch**: coarse pointers use a 32 / 40 / 48px control ramp (`--qds-control-size-lg` is now 48px) so dense,
  default and large controls stay distinct; toggles, which size from it, grow to 48 × 24px. Dense toolbars read
  the new `--qds-toolbar-dense-min-height` (40px; One 48px).
- **Fields**: filled and standout hover fills mix 8% of the foreground instead of 12%, keeping placeholder and
  affix text ≥ 4.5:1 in Fluent.
- **Tabs**: a floating badge inside a tab stays within the tab strip instead of being clipped.
- **Field groups**: below 30rem, groups of three or more unlabelled children wrap — the first child takes its own
  row and the joined corners follow the wrap. Pairs and groups with labelled fields stay on one row.
- **Navigation**: in a `q-drawer` or `nav`, a collapsed `QExpansionItem` (or any expansion in a mini drawer) with
  an active child shows the 3px indicator on its header; other collapsed expansions do not.
- **Expansion items**: hovering, focusing or pressing an expanded header now adds a state layer.
- **Split buttons**: the chevron segment is narrower (8px side padding, 34px wide at 32px height).
- **Mini drawer**: 4px list padding, so items are 40px wide at `:mini-width="48"`.
- **Forced colours**: navigation indicator rails and the selected `.qds-table-segmented` segment use `Highlight`.

## [0.8.0-rc.2] — 2026-09-29

### Added

- **Materials**: Windows 11 / SwiftUI-style acrylic on overlays — menus, popups, pickers, and notifications
  (regular), dialogs and the bottom sheet (thick), tooltips (thin) — with a hairline stroke and an inner top edge
  highlight.
  New tokens `--qds-material-*`, `--qds-mica-alt`, `--qds-backdrop`; opt-in `.qds-material` (`--thin`, `--thick`)
  for cards and other elements. Solid fallbacks without `backdrop-filter`, under
  `prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce`, and in forced-colors mode; `ink` stays solid.
- Menus fade and scale in from 98%; dialogs scale from 96% with a fade. Quasar `transition-duration` values
  shorter than the token still apply; longer ones are capped.
- `pnpm css:budget` (`scripts/css-budget.mjs`) caps `!important`, doubled Quasar class selectors, and component
  stylesheet lines; `verify:publish` runs it first.
- Icon-size ramp `--qds-icon-size-xs|sm|md|lg` (12/14/16/20px); `--qds-control-icon-size-*` alias it.
- The gallery gate lints sub-elements across the atlas families: no Material ligature icons, chat bubble tails,
  tree L-connectors, play-triangle carets, or raw white/black fills, and the icon-size tokens resolve.

### Changed

- The page shows the Mica backdrop (`--qds-backdrop`, a `background` value) on a fixed `body::before` layer tied
  to the window; header, footer, drawer, and toolbars use the opaque `--qds-mica-alt` tint (`--qds-toolbar-bg`).
- The bottom sheet is full-bleed below 600px and respects the bottom safe area.
- `--qds-menu-bg` now resolves to the translucent regular material; dialogs, menus, and tooltips carry the material
  stroke and edge highlight.
- Chat messages drop the bubble tail and use 32px circular avatars aligned to the bubble bottom.
- Stepper connectors pass through the dot centres; dot icons are 14px.
- QTree uses a single indent guide and the Phosphor caret (`tree.icon` in `qdsIconSet`) instead of the play triangle.
- QColor header and footer tabs are segmented controls; the swatch grid uses hairline gaps.
- Dark brand foreground (`--qds-fg-brand`) is lighter (≈ `#63acf6`) so brand text keeps 4.5:1 on hover layers.
- Dark thin material is 85% opaque (was 80%) so muted captions keep 4.5:1 over white content.
- Floating badges anchor 8px inside the host's top-end corner and grow outward instead of centring on it.
- Every `backdrop-filter` is emitted through one internal materials mixin; QInnerLoading now also carries the
  `-webkit-` prefix.
- Sass: `$control` no longer carries `icon-size-sm|md|lg`; read the new `$icon-size` map from `./tokens/default`
  instead (the `--qds-control-icon-size-*` custom properties remain).

### Fixed

- Multiline badges no longer break mid-word.
- Floating badges inside a QBtnGroup keep their counter width and paint above the next button.
- A coloured QBtnToggle keeps unselected segments unfilled with muted text; disabled segments stay unfilled.
- A floating badge no longer covers the last letter of an outline button label.
- Below 600px, banner actions stay on one end-aligned row.
- Breadcrumb icon separators no longer end a wrapped line.
- Gallery QRating row labels align with their card titles.
- README and the gallery Fonts tab describe Selawik as an optional display face; the display stack follows Inter.

## [0.8.0-rc.1] — 2026-09-28

Reference-driven Fluent 2 rebuild. Default controls are neutral-first; colour is
reserved for the primary action and status. The previous tonal look remains
available through opt-in classes.

### Breaking changes

- **Palette and neutral grammar reset** from the Fluent 2 web tokens: neutral
  grey surfaces, text, and strokes replace the warm cream neutrals and slate
  text; secondary is a charcoal neutral, info a neutral grey, accent marigold.
- **Control scale 36 → 32px**: buttons and fields use 24/32/40px
  (`--qds-control-size-sm|md|lg`); `dense` uses the 24px step.
- **Buttons are solid by default**: `color` + `unelevated` renders a solid role
  fill (was a tonal wash). No `color` renders the neutral button (surface fill,
  1px stroke). Badges with `color` are solid pills.
- **Fields place the label above the control** by default (32px control, 24px
  dense); the floating label moved to the opt-in `qds-field--float` (48px).
- **Radii**: controls 6px, cards and dialogs 12px.
- **Cards** lift with a layered shadow and no longer draw a stroke.
- **Dialogs** use a plain scrim without backdrop blur.
- **Lists and menus** use 32px desktop rows (36px comfortable) as rounded inset
  rows.
- **Removed** the `.qds-field--stacked` behaviour (label-above is now the
  default) and the `.qds-plugin-inner-loading` hook.
- **Selawik left the display stack**: `--qds-font-family-display` follows the
  body stack (Inter) unless an app sets it.
- `.qds-solid` is now meaningful only on chips; on buttons and badges it has no
  effect because `color` is already solid.

### Deprecated

- No-op tokens kept for compatibility and slated for removal:
  `--qds-tab-hover-bg`, `--qds-progress-stripe`, `--qds-media-frame-shadow`,
  and `--qds-card-border-mix`.

### Added

- `.qds-tonal` opt-in for the previous tonal wash on buttons and badges.
- Gallery Compare page placing Fluent 2 web components beside QDS defaults.

### Migration notes

- Keep the old tonal buttons or badges: add `class="qds-tonal"` next to `color`.
- Remove `class="qds-solid"` from buttons; `unelevated color="…"` is already
  solid. Keep it on chips that need a solid fill.
- Keep floating labels: add `class="qds-field--float"` to the field. Remove
  `qds-field--stacked`; the default already stacks the label above.
- Layouts sized around 36px buttons or 48px fields: re-check toolbars, table
  actions, and form rows against the 32px controls.
- Replace `.qds-plugin-inner-loading` with your own class on `QInnerLoading`
  if you relied on its blurred veil.
- Want Selawik for headings: import `fonts/selawik.css` and set
  `--qds-font-family-display: 'Selawik', var(--qds-font-family)` on `:root`.
- Stop reading or setting the deprecated tokens above; they no longer change
  the rendered output.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-09-16

Stable release of the Fluent 2 overhaul validated through the complete gallery,
accessibility, package, live-browser, and comparative visual gates. This release
contains all changes from `0.7.0-rc.1` through `0.7.0-rc.3` plus the final
post-RC accessibility corrections.

### Added

- Public field-label variants and responsive form-label utilities.
- Semantic geometry, row, state, typography, elevation, and progress tokens.
- Safe-area utility classes for One/mobile layouts.

### Changed

- Rebuilt Fluent field anatomy, selection controls, command surfaces, cards,
  lists, menus, tabs, sliders, and dark surface hierarchy around semantic tokens.
- Canonical variants are Fluent, Ink, One (`mobile`), and Terminal; legacy Air,
  Glass, Studio, and Feather inputs continue to normalize to supported variants.
- Unified Fluent radii and reduced Material-style chrome while preserving One
  touch geometry and the distinct Ink and Terminal systems.

### Fixed

- Ensured muted text meets WCAG 4.5:1 across Fluent and Ink light surfaces,
  including tinted role washes.
- Added accessible names to variant progress bars and retained clean axe and
  Lighthouse evidence.
- Corrected toggle thumb centering/travel, radio-dot scale, nested dark surfaces,
  media assets, responsive tabs, RTL geometry, and theme-transition test races.

### Verification

- Typecheck and package build pass.
- Playwright gallery gate: 168/168 desktop and mobile tests.
- Production Lighthouse: Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO, and Agentic
  Browsing all score 100 on desktop and mobile.
- Independent browser and comparative visual review returned GO.

## [0.7.0-rc.3] — 2026-08-27

Fluent 2 anatomy alignment + Material-tell removal, validated by comparative
vision-agent review against Fluent 2 official, Apple HIG, and Samsung One UI.

### Changed

- **Toggle/switch geometry rebuilt**: thumb 12px vertically centered in a 16px
  track (was off by 2px hanging below), symmetric travel (37.5% off, 75% on —
  was 20-62.5% with thumb buried in the track). Dense: 11px, 36%/80%. Mobile:
  44×24 track with mirrored travel. Radio dot scaled ×1.36 → 59.5% of the ring
  (was 44%). All offsets are `--qds-toggle-*` custom properties.
- **Quiet command surfaces**: QBtnGroup/QBtnToggle and the gallery mode/variant
  switcher no longer use a Material capsule shell (outer border + padding +
  filled rail). Transparent group with 1px hairline separators and quiet tonal
  selected/hover states — Fluent 2 command-surface anatomy.
- **Dark surface hierarchy repaired**: `surface-1` was darker than `surface-0`
  (inverted), causing nested panels to disappear. New order: canvas `#1a1d22`
  → raised `#21252b` → `#282d34` → `#31373f`. Expansion content is now opaque
  raised surface + hairline instead of an alpha-blended tint.
- **Radius unification (Fluent 2)**: cards 8px (was 12), controls/menus 4px
  (was 8/12). Ink/mobile/terminal keep their distinctive variant radii.
- **Slider/range thinned**: track 2px (was 6), thumb 16px (was 18), 1px stroke
  (was 3px), shadow removed.
- **Tab indicator**: 2px underline (was 3px rail).
- **One UI mobile**: list separators now inset-aligned with content (was
  full-width). Added `.qds-safe-bottom` / `.qds-safe-top` utility classes for
  `env(safe-area-inset-*)` rhythm.

### Fixed

- Stale gallery copy updated: "3px accent rail" → "2px accent underline".

## [0.7.0-rc.2] — 2026-08-25

Alignment republish: the npm tarball now matches the production site exactly.

### Changed

- Fluent light muted text darkened a further step `#5a6a80` → `#556579`, clearing
  WCAG 4.5:1 also on soft role washes (≥ 4.84:1 on info-tinted surfaces, ~5.0–7.1:1
  on standard surfaces).
- Linear-progress stripe gradient consumes the new `--qds-progress-stripe` token
  (added to `QDS_TOKENS` and the public token inventory test).
- List item caption/overline labels are themed via `--qds-fg-muted` instead of
  Quasar's raw `rgba(0, 0, 0, …)` defaults.
- Gallery shell: added meta description; `favicon.ico` shipped alongside
  `favicon.svg`. Test stabilization: 150ms settle after theme/variant switches in
  the catalog forms suite.

## [0.7.0-rc.1] — 2026-08-25

First public prerelease of the Fluent 2 overhaul (an intentional visual break).
Note: `0.6.4` was published to npm without a changelog entry; the committed `0.6.5`
was never published and is folded into this release track.

### Added

- Field label variant class contract: `qds-field--float` (animated center-to-border,
  the Fluent default), `qds-field--stacked-animated`, `qds-field--stacked`,
  `qds-field--start`, plus the `qds-form--label-start|--sm|--md|--lg` parent
  utilities. Start labels collapse to stacked below `45rem`.
- Semantic field geometry tokens: `--qds-field-size-sm/md/lg`,
  `--qds-field-label-size-rest/float`, `--qds-field-label-gap`,
  `--qds-field-label-column`, `--qds-field-value-inset-block-start/end`,
  `--qds-field-transition`.
- Shared row tokens `--qds-row-gap`, `--qds-row-radius`, `--qds-row-inset`, now
  consumed by menu, list, drawer, tree, option-group, markup-table, and editor
  toolbar styling instead of duplicated raw geometry.

### Changed

- **Semantic token migration** across all component families (`--qds-text` →
  `--qds-fg-default`, etc.). Old `--qds-text*` names remain defined as aliases in
  `src/themes/fallbacks.scss`, so existing CSS consumers keep working.
- Reworked field anatomy: 48px normal / 40px dense outlined and filled controls,
  vertically centered rest labels, animated border-float labels when
  focused/filled, protected value band, no label/value overlap.
- Tightened Fluent surface hierarchy (quieter cards with intentional hairlines),
  compact desktop selection-control geometry, lighter transient surfaces, and
  semantic table hover/selected state layers.
- Removed dead `.qds-variant-feather` selectors (~211 lines); the runtime already
  normalized `feather` → `ink`.

### Fixed

- Fluent light muted text darkened `#64748b` → `#556579`; token-name labels,
  list captions/overlines, and all small muted text now meet WCAG 4.5:1 on
  every light surface including soft role washes (≥ 4.8:1 on info-tinted
  surfaces, 4.93–7.1:1 elsewhere).

## [0.6.3] — 2026-08-06

### Added

- Expanded gallery and Histoire proof coverage across canonical variants, official Quasar states, stable public modes, responsive layouts, accessibility, RTL, and reduced motion.
- Added deterministic browser contracts for Fluent foundations, control geometry, low-chrome composition, semantic dark contrast, public token parity, and the optional QWindow extension.

### Changed

- **Variant convergence.** The visible variant set is now `fluent`, `ink`, `mobile` (One), and `terminal`. The Air visual system is removed; its low-border/selective-material behavior is absorbed by Fluent. Feather is renamed to Ink and is now a colored, flat, paper-neutral editorial surface with charcoal anchors and coordinated pastel role washes (no longer monochrome).
- Fluent inherits the legacy Air translucency behavior without the iOS palette or oversized geometry.
- Ink replaces Feather as the paper-neutral variant, now with deliberate pastel role surfaces across cards, tables, progress, badges, and selection.
- One (mobile) gains its own focus blocks and touch rhythm treatment distinct from Fluent.
- Gallery and Histoire variant switchers, scenes, and story controls enumerate the four canonical variants only. The Air showcase and Feather showcase are removed as public surfaces.
- Gallery mobile header layout repaired at 390px: single accessible horizontally scrollable tab strip with visible but non-obstructive overflow; compact control layout avoids competing clipped scrollers.
- Reworked Fluent buttons, fields, chips, icons, lists, ratings, cards, and QWindow chrome around a shared control scale, explicit framing, and measurable optical alignment.
- Separated normal chips, dense chips, and badges into a 30px / 26px / 22px hierarchy, and tuned Fluent dark semantic fills and soft surfaces independently from light mode.
- Replaced QWindow text glyph actions with Phosphor SVG icons while preserving the optional module and native QWindow behavior.

### Fixed

- Kept outlined labels, values, marginal icons, multiple chips, and validation messages aligned and contained across normal, dense, standalone, and mobile fields.
- Removed redundant card frames and separators while retaining explicit readable, bordered, transient, One, and Terminal boundaries.
- Prevented mobile tab arrows from covering neighboring labels and kept deep-linked active tabs inside dedicated arrow lanes.
- Removed fixture-created scene/comparison overflow, raw icon ligatures, undersized QWindow glyphs, and an extraneous QWindow attribute warning.
- Reconciled all 251 public token names with exact fallback/default token-layer emissions without narrowing the existing TypeScript token union.

### Compatibility

- Runtime legacy aliases preserved: `air`, `glass`, and `studio` inputs resolve to `fluent`; `feather` resolves to `ink`. Persisted state and body classes remain compatible.
- The `qds-variant-air`, `qds-variant-glass`, and `qds-variant-feather` body classes are no longer emitted for new sessions; legacy classes are cleared on variant change.
- Public TypeScript types expose `CanonicalDesignSystemVariantName` (`fluent` | `ink` | `mobile` | `terminal`) and `LegacyDesignSystemVariantName` (`studio` | `air` | `glass` | `feather`) for migration.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Removed duplicate borders, rounded corners, and shadows when a table is used as flush direct content inside a card, while retaining section separators and standalone table frames.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-07-08

### Changed

- Added reusable readable/opaque card surface and header classes for image-backed layouts, and updated the Scenes gallery to use them for stronger live contrast.
- Lightened Air typography weights and control icon opacity/stroke treatment so the variant reads thinner without losing contrast.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-07

### Added

- Added an optional `@bastvi/quasar-design-system/qwindow` module with `QdsWindow`, QWindow type re-exports, and opt-in QWindow extension styles at `./css/extensions/qwindow` and `./css/extensions/qwindow/layered`.
- Added gallery and Histoire QWindow proofs that import native QWindow CSS separately from the default QDS bundle.

## [0.5.6] — 2026-07-07

### Changed

- Deepened native-pattern styling and proof coverage for complex controls: `QStepper`, `QCarousel`, `QEditor`, and `QUploader` now expose richer active/done/error/navigation, thumbnail/control, toolbar/dropdown/focus, and upload-state treatments.
- Expanded picker coverage for `QSelect` multiple chips/menu states, `QColor` spectrum/tune/alpha views, `QDate` disabled/month/year views, `QTime` AM/PM landscape mode, and `QPopupEdit` popup chrome.
- Updated public project guidance to reflect built `dist/` TypeScript entrypoints and the current five built-in variants.

### Fixed

- Kept the catalog a11y gate green after adding QColor tune inputs by extending the existing known Quasar picker exclusion to QColor's internal unlabeled channel inputs.

## [0.5.5] — 2026-07-07

### Changed

- Rebalanced the Air variant so it is more translucent than Fluent while preserving contrast with stronger tonal tint, border, and chrome guardrails.
- Improved `QColor` picker chrome with cleaner tabs, animated state transitions, and square palette swatches.
- Refined `QTree` row spacing, indentation, hover treatment, and RTL-safe child padding.

### Fixed

- Kept `QToggle` knobs inset inside their tracks in normal and dense branches.
- Strengthened tab/tree hover transitions without changing active tabs back into filled pills.

## [0.5.4] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Fixed the deployed gallery Media section `QVideo` proof overflowing into the following Scrolling section on wide viewports by constraining the demo iframe frame.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-07-07

### Changed

- Made the deployed gallery default to `system` mode so it follows the OS light/dark preference on first load.
- Added initial `sm` / `md` / `lg` control and icon-size CSS tokens for calmer default field, button, chip, and expansion control proportions.
- Rebalanced Fluent/default card material with clearer surface and border separation while keeping Air/acrylic card chrome softer.
- Updated the gallery icon proof row to exercise Quasar icon-set-driven controls and `sm` / `md` / `lg` button sizing.

### Fixed

- Fixed `QSlider` / `QRange` always-visible labels rendering as unstyled square chips, including dark mode.
- Reduced oversized/aggressive internal control icons for fields, selects, chips, buttons, and expansion chevrons.
- Updated visual expectations so deterministic tests explicitly force light mode where they assert light-token values.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Softened the default Fluent card material by reducing resting card border mix and dark elevation weight.
- Retuned Air dark surfaces toward a cooler, airier material so Air separates more clearly from dark Fluent.
- Reworked `QBtnGroup`, `QBtnToggle`, and `QPagination` into cohesive segmented controls with shared shells and internal dividers instead of per-button boxes.
- Deepened `QDate` day/month/year, selected, today, focus, and range-state styling with tokenized rounded cells and range fills.

### Fixed

- Added gallery and Histoire `QDate` range examples plus Playwright assertions so range styling is covered by the release gate.
- Updated gallery visual assertions for the new Fluent/Air token contract and stabilized variant restoration after the legacy `glass` alias check.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-07-02

### Added

- Expanded Quasar sub-element proof coverage across the release gallery and Histoire catalog:
  - Forms and pickers now expose and test QSlider, QRange, QCheckbox, QRadio, QToggle, QOptionGroup, QFile, and QInput/QSelect state surfaces.
  - Data, navigation, and layout coverage now proves QAvatar, QPagination, QDrawer, and consolidated QTabPanels treatment.
  - Media, complex, progress, and loading coverage now proves QCarousel, QEditor, deterministic QUploader queue/progress/error/uploaded states, QScrollArea, QSplitter, QTimeline, QKnob, QCircularProgress, and QSpinner.
  - Overlay/plugin coverage now proves Air QMenu material, Air/Feather/Terminal Notify treatment, and plugin-scoped QInnerLoading.

### Changed

- Deepened built-in variant structure beyond token swaps:
  - **One** (`mobile` key) now has stronger touch-first row/menu/control rhythm, grouped tabs, and bottom-nav depth.
  - **Air** now has cleaner sheet/media/nested chrome treatment with low resting noise and contextual overlay depth.
  - **Feather** now has more matte paper/document styling for cards, tables, forms, popups, loading surfaces, and media.
- Expanded the gallery Variant lab with nested chrome and table examples.

### Fixed

- Added regression coverage for One rhythm, Air nested-chrome shadowlessness, Feather matte/table behavior, and existing Terminal typography/pagination behavior.
- Added final gallery and Histoire release gates for the expanded component proof wave.
- Ensured `configureDesignSystem({ rootClass })` always keeps the required `.qds-ui` scope class and treats `rootClass` as an additional hook, matching the documented CSS-scoping contract.

### Notes

- The following interaction-heavy states remain documented manual-only exceptions rather than brittle automated gates: QPopupEdit's teleported popup, QPageScroller scroll threshold, QSlideItem and QPullToRefresh gestures, QInfiniteScroll scroll-triggered loading, and any future LoadingBar ownership relocation.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added

- Added `terminal` built-in variant (`qds-variant-terminal`): dark amber developer
  UI with near-black surfaces, #fcc40d amber primary, crisp hairline cards,
  restrained glow, and tight 6px control radius.
- Added terminal scene wallpaper SVG and Playwright variant/scenes expectations.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-25

### Added

- Added a gallery **Scenes** tab with deterministic owned SVG wallpapers for
  comparing `fluent`, `air`, `mobile`, and `feather` materials in image-rich
  contexts.
- Added visual scene tests covering scene mount, Air material tokens, and
  Feather paper/e-ink behavior.
- Added public inline icon-gap tokens for comfortable default spacing and
  compact dense spacing across buttons, chips, badges, and select chips.

### Changed

- Retuned default `fluent` card acrylic to use a neutral explicit tint token
  instead of primary-blue resting glow.
- Retuned `air` toward a modern matte-glass material with stronger blur,
  image-friendly translucency, and tokenized acrylic tint/depth.
- Refined `feather` as a warm paper/e-ink variant with minimal glass behavior,
  muted sage/earth actions, paper borders, and low-fatigue dark mode.
- Improved default Quasar coverage with explicit `QHeader` styling and focused
  `QBtnDropdown` / `QBtnGroup` / `QBtnToggle` assertions.

### Fixed

- Consolidated duplicate LoadingBar styling so the catalog/loading-data rule is
  the single source for the public QDS loading-bar treatment.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-24

### Changed

- **Built TypeScript entrypoints.** Runtime TS exports (`.`, `./runtime`, `./tokens`,
  `./themes`, `./icons/quasar-icon-set`) now resolve to pre-compiled ESM JS and
  `.d.ts` files in `dist/`. Consumers no longer need to compile this package's
  TypeScript — bundlers pick up the built output directly.
- `main` and `types` fields now point at `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.d.ts`.
- Export map uses `types` + `import` conditions for all TS entrypoints.
- Added `pnpm build` (`tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`) and wired it into
  `verify:publish` / `prepublishOnly`.
- SCSS, CSS, and font exports remain source-first (`src/`) — no change for
  Sass consumers.
- Packed tarball verified: all public subpaths (JS, `.d.ts`, SCSS, fonts) resolve
  from the extracted package.

### Notes

- Visual output, token contract, and component coverage are unchanged.
- Gallery, Histoire, and Playwright gates are unaffected.

## [0.2.0] — prior

- Initial public-surface release with source-only TS entrypoints.
- Fluent 2-inspired design tokens, Quasar component overrides, runtime theme
  controller, Phosphor icon set, and optional font CSS.
